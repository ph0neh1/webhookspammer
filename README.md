Run start.bat as a adminstrator before running main.py

## Modules and Coding Langauges
Discord Module, Requests Module, Pip Module, Python 3.8 and higher, and Batch.

## Tested and Supported Operating Systems
start.bat is only usable for Windows operating machines

main.py should work on any operating system that can run python

**Windows 11 and 10 have been tested and are working as of 2023-08-19.**

## Current Issues

Problem : When running start.bat the tool will tell you that python is not installed even though it is installed

Solution #1 : Add python to your PATH
