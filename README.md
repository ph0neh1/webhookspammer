# Discord Webhook Spammer

## Introduction
This script allows you to send messages repeatedly to a Discord webhook. Before you begin, follow the instructions below for setup and usage.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
- `pip3` installed.
- Adding Python to your PATH.

### Method 1: Using start.bat
1. Run `start.bat` as an administrator. You can either:
   - Right-click `start.bat` and select "Run as administrator."
   - Open Command Prompt as administrator, navigate to the script directory, and run `start start.bat`.

### Method 2: Manual Module Installation
1. Install the required modules using `pip3`:
- Discord Module
- Request Module

2. Open your command line and run one of the following commands (choose the correct one for your system):

`python main.py`

`py main.py`

`python3 main.py`


## Known Issues

### Problem:
When running `start.bat`, the tool incorrectly reports that Python is not installed, even though it is.

### Solution:
Add Python to your PATH environment variable. This can be done during the Python installation or by modifying your system's PATH settings.
