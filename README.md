Run start.bat as a adminstrator before running main.py

## Modules and Coding Langauges
Discord Module, Requests Module, Pip Module, Python 3.8 and higher, and Batch.

## Windows Instructions
Before you start make sure that you have python 3.8 or higher installed on your system and your also going to need to have pip3 installed, Also if have not already added Python to your PATH then do so.

You can either use start.bat or manually install the required modules yourself

### Method 1 [Using start.bat]
Right click start.bat and run as administrator or you can run CMD as administrator and cd to the directory with the scripts and run `start start.bat`

### Method 2 [Manually install required Modules]
You can copy and paste the commmands into CMD below to install the required modules with pip3

`pip3 install Discord`

`pip3 install requests`

After you do that run a command prompt window as administrator and run one of the commands below [Make sure you pick the correct one for your system]

`python main.py`

`py main.py`

`python3 main.py`

## Current Issues

Problem : When running start.bat the tool will tell you that python is not installed even though it is installed

Solution #1 : Add python to your PATH
